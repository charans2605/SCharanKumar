### Problem-1: Calculator using Class  
**Description:**  
A program to create a simple calculator using a class. The calculator performs operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus on two numbers.

**Calculator inputs:**
- `a` (double)
- `b` (double)
- `type of operation` (string)

**File:** `Problem-1.py`

### Problem-2: Odd Number Series Generator  
**Description:**  
A program to generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1, based on a user-provided input number `a`. The program will display the first `a` odd numbers in sequence.

**Example:**
```
Input: 1
Output: 1

Input: 2
Output: 1, 3

Input: 3
Output: 1, 3, 5
```

**File:** `Problem-2.py`

### Problem-3: Conditional Odd Number Series  
**Description:**  
A program to generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1 based on the value of `a`.

- If `a` is odd: display `a` odd numbers.
- If `a` is even: display `(a-1)` odd numbers.

**Example:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 1, 3, 5
```


**File:** `Problem-3.py`

### Problem-4: Multiple Count in List  
**Description:**  
A program to count how many numbers in a given list are multiples of 1 through 9. The result is displayed as a dictionary with the multiple as the key and the count as the value.

**Example:**
```
Input List: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]
Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
```

**File:** `Problem-4.py`
